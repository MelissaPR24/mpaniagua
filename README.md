## Welcome to my website!

Hi! I am Melissa, and I made this website to share my projects and some visualizations I have made.

I am passionate about data! I love how we can use suitable data to gain business insights and make informed decisions, and not just to observe how a company is doing through descriptive statistics, but also to make predictions. This motivated me to start graduate school and grow in the art of data. 

Some of my interests are data visualization, data mining and analytics, and machine learning algorithms.

## Projects

### 1. ABC Wireless Inc: Telephone Company Prediction Model

Constructed supervised models like logistic regression and decision tree to predict which customers will churn or not based on several variables.

### 2. CRISA Asian Market Research Agency: Consumers Segmentation - [Document](https://github.com/MelissaPR24/ML_MelissaPR.git)

Designed an unsupervised K-means machine learning algorithm to generate cluster market segmentation based on their similarities in order to target the company's marketing promotions more efficiently, save time and money, and provide accurate rewards to its clients.

### 3. American Universities Clustering Model - [Document](https://github.com/MelissaPR24/ML_MelissaPR.git)

Implemented unsupervised K-means model to cluster universities based on different measurements to get insights and make predictions.

### 4. Flight Status Classification Model - [Document](https://github.com/MelissaPR24/ML_MelissaPR.git)

Classified flight status utilizing a Naive Bayes supervised model to predict if a new flight will be classified as delayed or on-time.

### 5. Transportation Problem in LP - [Document](https://github.com/MelissaPR24/QM_MelissaPR.git)

Developed an LP model to find the optimal solution to minimize the combined cost of production from each plant and shipping to different warehouses.

### 6. Acceptance Loan Classification Model - [Document](https://github.com/MelissaPR24/ML_MelissaPR.git)

Performed a k-NN classification model utilizing open data on 5000 customers from a financial institution to predict whether a liable customer would accept a personal loan offer.

### 7. Mathematical Optimization Model - [Document](https://github.com/MelissaPR24/QM_MelissaPR.git)

Defined, formulated, and solved a mathematical optimization model - linear programming model to efficiently assign students in groups. The main goal of this project is to maximize the chance that each group will do well on a class project based on decision variables.
 
### 8. COVID-19 Dashboard - [Visual](https://github.com/MelissaPR24/mpaniagua.git) 

This is an example of a US COVID dashboard I made utilizing Google Data Sudio.

### 9. Sankey Diagram - [Visual](https://github.com/MelissaPR24/mpaniagua.git) 

Built a Sankey flow Diagram to understand Americansâ€™ academic path and identify the highest dropout rates to get insights.
