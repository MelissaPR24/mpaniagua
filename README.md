## Welcome to my website!

Hi! I am Melissa, and I made this website to share my projects and some visualizations I have made.

I am passionate about data! I love how we can use suitable data to gain business insights and make informed decisions, and not just to observe how a company is doing through descriptive statistics, but also to make predictions. This motivated me to start graduate school and grow in the art of data. 

Some of my interests are data visualization, data mining and analytics, and machine learning algorithms.
